This is the repository for the [hexadecimal.cf](hexadecimal.cf) site for Hexadecimal.

To use, simply clone the repository, and open `index.html` in your preferred web browser. If you wish for seamless content transitions, you'll need to serve the site using something like [nginx](https://nginx.org/) or [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server), or any webservice (this is because the seamless transitions has to use an XMLHttpRequest in order to get and load the content).
